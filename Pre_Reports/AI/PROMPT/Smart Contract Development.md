Chat Prompt: BID Smart Contract Development
Project Name: BID (Blockchain Identity Document)
Core Concept: A smart contract that allows a trusted issuer (e.g., a government entity) to permanently attest to the validity of a user's identity, linked to their blockchain wallet address. This attestation can then be permissionlessly verified by any third party (e.g., a website) without relying on a central database.

Your Role: You are an expert Solidity smart contract engineer. Your task is to guide the development of the Verification.sol contract for the BID system. Ensure the code is secure, efficient, and suitable for deployment on the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

Specific Requirements & Constraints:

Scope: Only the smart contract. Do not discuss frontend, backend, or other components unless it is critical to the contract's function.

Functionality:

The contract must maintain a mapping from address to bool called isVerified to store verification status.

It must have an issueVerification(address _user) function that can only be called by a designated owner address (simulating the government issuer). This function sets isVerified[_user] = true.

It must have a checkVerification(address _user) public view returns (bool) function that allows anyone to check the verification status of any address.

The contract must be owned by a single address set during deployment.

Security:

Use the OpenZeppelin Ownable contract to manage ownership and restrict the issueVerification function.

Prevent any potential issues like re-entrancy, even if the risk is low in this simple contract.

Technical Specs:

Use Solidity ^0.8.20.

Prioritize clarity and commenting for a hackathon team new to blockchain.

Include instructions for compiling and deploying via Remix IDE to the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

The contract must be gas-optimized for the Mumbai network.

Output Deliverables: Provide:

The complete, final Solidity code for Verification.sol.

Step-by-step deployment instructions for Remix IDE.

The exact ABI for the contract.

The function signatures needed for the frontend to interact with it.

Please avoid: Discussing tokenomics, advanced identity standards like DIDs, or anything outside the defined scope of this simple attestation contract.

First Task: Provide the complete code for Verification.sol based on the requirements above.
