### **Project Title: SecureID-PoC (Proof of Concept)**
**Core Idea:** A user receives a government-issued cryptographic stamp on their blockchain address. They can then use this stamp to prove their identity to any website without ever uploading their ID document.

### **Simplified Architecture for 1 Day**
We will simulate the most complex parts (the government) and build a functional demo of the user flow.

1.  **Government's Role (Simulated):** A website that "issues" a verification token.
2.  **User's Role (Real):** A MetaMask wallet that receives and holds the token.
3.  **Website's Role (Real):** A simple web app that requests proof of verification and checks it.

### **Phase 1: Preparation & Setup (First 2 Hours)**
**Goal:** Get everyone's environment ready and understand the flow.

*   **Task 1: Tool Installation (30 mins)**
    *   Everyone installs: **Node.js**, **VS Code**, and the **MetaMask** browser extension.
    *   *Cost: $0.*

*   **Task 2: Wallet & Testnet Setup (30 mins)**
    *   Each team member creates a MetaMask wallet.
    *   Connect MetaMask to the **Polygon Mumbai Testnet** (faster & cheaper than Ethereum).
        *   Network Name: `Mumbai`
        *   RPC URL: `https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com`
        *   Chain ID: `80001`
        *   Currency Symbol: `MATIC`
    *   Use a Mumbai faucet (e.g., [mumbaifaucet.com](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)) to get free testnet MATIC for gas fees.
    *   *Cost: $0.*

*   **Task 3: Project Setup (1 hour)**
    *   Create a new project folder.
    *   Initialize a Node.js project: `npm init -y`
    *   Install critical libraries:
        *   `npm install ethers` // To talk to the blockchain
        *   `npm install express` // To run a local server
        *   `npm install qrcode` // To generate QR codes
    *   Create two files: `issuer.html` (simulated government) and `verifier.html` (the demo website).

### **Phase 2: Smart Contract (Hours 2-4)**
**Goal:** Create the "verification registry" on the blockchain.

*   **Task 1: Write the Contract (1.5 hours)**
    *   Create a file named `Verification.sol`.
    *   This contract will be a simple mapping: `mapping(address => bool) public isVerified;`
    *   Write two functions:
        1.  `function issueVerification(address user)`: Can only be called by the "owner" (which will be our simulated government).
        2.  `function checkVerification(address user) public view returns (bool)`: For any website to check if a user is verified.
    *   *This is simple, effective, and demonstrates the core concept.*

*   **Task 2: Deploy the Contract (1.5 hours)**
    *   Use **Remix IDE** (remix.ethereum.org), a web-based tool. No installation needed.
    *   Compile `Verification.sol`.
    *   Deploy it to the **Mumbai Testnet** by connecting Remix to your MetaMask wallet.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Save the deployed contract address. This is the source of truth for our system.

### **Phase 3: Build the Simulated Government Issuer (Hours 4-6)**
**Goal:** Create a simple web page that acts as the "government service" where a user gets verified.

*   **Task: Build `issuer.html`**
    *   This is a simple form that asks a user to connect their wallet.
    *   It has a button: "Get Government-Verified".
    *   When clicked, the page (using Ethers.js) will call the `issueVerification` function on your deployed smart contract, passing the user's wallet address.
    *   The user pays the gas fee (with free testnet MATIC), and their address is now marked as `true` in the contract's mapping.
    *   The page can generate a QR code containing the contract address and the user's address. This is their "proof".

### **Phase 4: Build the Verifier Website (Hours 6-8)**
**Goal:** Create the demo website that requires proof of ID.

*   **Task: Build `verifier.html`**
    *   This page has a button: "Login with SecureID".
    *   When clicked, it prompts the user to either:
        *   **Option A (QR Scan):** Scan the QR code they got from the "government" site.
        *   **Option B (Manual):** Connect their wallet directly.
    *   Once the website has the user's wallet address, it uses Ethers.js to call the `checkVerification(userAddress)` function on the smart contract.
    *   If the function returns `true`, the website displays: "**Identity Verified! Access Granted.**"
    *   If `false`, it displays: "**Identity Not Found. Access Denied.**"

### **Phase 5: Testing & Dry Run (Hours 8-9)**
**Goal:** Make sure the entire flow works perfectly.

*   **Test the Happy Path:**
    1.  Go to `issuer.html` -> Connect Wallet -> Click "Get Verified" -> Confirm transaction in MetaMask.
    2.  Go to `verifier.html` -> Click "Login" -> Connect Wallet -> See "Access Granted".
*   **Test the Failure Path:**
    1.  Go to `verifier.html` with a new, unverified wallet address. See "Access Denied".
*   **Test the QR Flow:** Test the QR code generation and scanning.

### **Phase 6: Presentation Prep (Final 3 Hours)**
**Goal:** Script and rehearse a killer demo.

*   **Task 1: Create a 3-Slide Presentation (1 hour)**
    *   **Slide 1 (Problem):** "Today, uploading your ID means risking it in a data breach."
    *   **Slide 2 (Our Solution):** Diagram of the flow: Government -> Smart Contract -> User -> Website.
    *   **Slide 3 (Demo):** "Now, let me show you how it works in under 60 seconds."

*   **Task 2: Script the Demo (1 hour)**
    *   **Narrator:** "First, I'm a citizen going to the government portal to get verified." (Shows `issuer.html`, connects wallet, clicks button).
    *   **Narrator:** "I confirm the transaction. My wallet address is now permanently and tamper-proof verified on the Polygon blockchain." (Shows MetaMask confirmation).
    *   **Narrator:** "Now, I go to a financial website that requires ID." (Opens `verifier.html`). "I click login... and instantly, I'm in! The website checked the blockchain, saw I was verified, and granted me accessâ€”all without me ever uploading a single document."
    *   **Rehearse this until it's smooth.**

*   **Task 3: Prepare for Q&A (1 hour)**
    *   **Expected Question:** "Is this really the government?"
        *   **Answer:** "For this PoC, we simulated the government's role. In production, the government would run this issuing service, and their address would be the only one allowed to call the `issueVerification` function, making it truly secure and official."
    *   **Expected Question:** "What about privacy? The wallet address is public."
        *   **Answer:** "This is a foundational proof-of-concept. The next step is to integrate Zero-Knowledge Proofs, allowing a user to generate proof of verification without even revealing their wallet address, maximizing privacy."
